# KohoCarpet

Admittedly naive implementation of [Kohonens self organizing map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map) algorithm.

Not fit for any real use, but the plots of the networks activation values have certain aesthetic appeal.

If you wonder why, there are several reasons. Among them is topology of the map (torus) and that my modification of the algorithm only picks one example per iteration.
Also the metric for selecting neighborhood is all wrong.
