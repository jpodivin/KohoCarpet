# KohoCarpet

Admittedly naive implementation of [Kohonens self organizing map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map) algorithm.

Not fit for any real use, but the plots of the networks activation values have certain aesthetic appeal.

If you wonder why, it's because the map wraps in on itself as torus. This, among other reasons, causes problems with convergence
of the network nodes.
